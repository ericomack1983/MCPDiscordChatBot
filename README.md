Project Overview

This project integrates a Discord bot, a Python-based AI agent, and ChatGPT to test
real-time interactions between an autonomous agent and a large language model (LLM).
The system allows users to communicate through Discord, where the AI agent interprets
messages, manages context, and interacts with ChatGPT to generate intelligent responses
or actions. The goal is to evaluate how well an AI agent can serve as a dynamic interface
between users and backend systems through natural language.
