# MCPDiscordChatBot
MCP Server Study Project – Short Description

This project aims to develop a Python-based MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to understand how AI agents interact with external tools and structured context. The setup is integrated with a Discord chatbot named Agent Smith, which communicates with the MCP server to process requests before passing them to ChatGPT. This creates a full communication flow:

**Communication Flow:
Discord Chat Bot (Agent Smith) → MCP Server (Python) → ChatGPT**

The project uses the following technologies:
	•	discord.py – to build and manage the Discord agent
	•	Python – for the MCP server logic and tool implementations
	•	OpenAI Library – to connect the MCP server to ChatGPT and handle responses

This environment serves as a hands-on study of MCP architecture, context management, and real-time AI interactions within Discord.
